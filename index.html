          <h3><span>1</span>Is Africa an example of peace for Colombia?</h3>
          <p>
            While there are African countries that have experienced significant conflicts in the past and present, there
            are also examples of African nations working diligently to promote peace and stability in the region. For
            instance, Ghana has been recognized for its political stability and commitment to democracy, making it a
            positive example in terms of peace and development in Africa.
          </p>
          <h3><span>2</span>Causal factors involved.</h3>
          <p>
            However, it's important to consider that each country and each context is unique, and what works in one
            place may not be directly applicable elsewhere. Colombia's situation is unique, and the peacebuilding
            process in the country should be approached according to its own characteristics and specific challenges.

            <p>
              He was a South African politician, president from 1989-1994. His presidency was characterized by a policy
              of reforms aimed at overcoming racial segregation of apartheid. To achieve this, he repealed existing
              segregationist laws, released several black politicians from prison, including Nelson Mandela, legalized
              the African National Congress (ANC), and endowed the country with a new non-racial constitution.

            <p>A South African leader, an icon of the fight against apartheid. In 1952, Mandela played a significant
              role in a campaign that challenged the so-called pass laws, which required black individuals to carry
              documents proving they were authorized to be in areas reserved for whites. Disagreeing with this, Mandela
              began his political involvement against apartheid.</p>

            <h3>Frederik de Klerk</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
              "He played an essential role in South Africa by leading political reforms that led to the transition to
              democracy and the end of apartheid. He released Nelson Mandela and lifted anti-apartheid bans, initiated
              historic dialogues with the African National Congress (ANC), and collaborated with the Truth and
              Reconciliation Commission (TRC) to investigate apartheid crimes. His leadership enabled a peaceful
              transition to democracy in 1994, with elections that brought Mandela to the presidency. De Klerk was
              instrumental in leading political reforms, negotiating with the ANC, participating in the TRC, and in the
              transition towards peace and reconciliation in South Africa."

              1. In South Africa, racial segregation consisted of the systematic separation of people in daily life
              activities, while in Colombia, discrimination against the Afro-Colombian population and others has been a
              triggering factor for violence in the central-western region of the country.
              <br>
              2. Initially, South Africa used violent forms of struggle, but in pursuit of lasting changes, nonviolent
              forms were adopted. In Colombia, there has been a period of violence lasting over 40 years that has
              directly or indirectly affected the entire population, still striving for an end to violence and the
              pursuit of peace.

              3. Apartheid was the system of racial segregation in South Africa and Namibia from 1948 to 1992, involving
              injustices and human rights violations. Different insurgent groups in Colombia have been violating human
              rights since 1946.
              <br>
              4. The Sharpeville massacre was a moment when police forces attacked people protesting against apartheid
              and pass laws, setting them on fire and leaving around 69 dead and many injured. Various massacres
              throughout the Andean region of Colombia have sparked multiple protests in rejection of the violence.

              5. United Democratic Front (UDF): a union of over 700 organizations aimed at establishing a unified South
              Africa.
              <br>
              6. Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC): In South Africa, the TRC played a crucial role in promoting
              healing and reconciliation by allowing victims and perpetrators of apartheid-era crimes to share their
              stories and seek amnesty. Implementing a similar mechanism in Colombia could provide a platform for
              addressing historical injustices, acknowledging victims' suffering, and fostering national unity through
              dialogue and accountability processes
